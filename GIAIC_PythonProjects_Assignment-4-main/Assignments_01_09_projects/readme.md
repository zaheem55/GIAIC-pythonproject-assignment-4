## 🚀 Project List

### 1️⃣ **Mad Libs Python Project**
   - A fun word-based game where users input words to complete a story.
   - Demonstrates user input and string manipulation in Python.

### 2️⃣ **Guess the Number Game (Computer)**
   - The computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it.
   - Implements loops, conditions, and user interaction.

### 3️⃣ **Guess the Number Game (User)**
   - The user selects a number, and the computer tries to guess it.
   - Uses binary search and logical conditions.

### 4️⃣ **Rock, Paper, Scissors Python Project**
   - A simple game where the user plays against the computer.
   - Uses random module and conditional statements.

### 5️⃣ **Hangman Python Project**
   - A word-guessing game where the user tries to guess a hidden word.
   - Implements loops, conditionals, and string operations.

### 6️⃣ **Countdown Timer Python Project**
   - A timer that counts down from a given time to zero.
   - Uses the `time.sleep()` function for delays.

### 7️⃣ **Password Generator Python Project**
   - Generates strong and random passwords based on user input.
   - Uses Python’s `random` module and string manipulation.

### 8️⃣ **Python Streamlit BMI Calculator Web App**
   - A web-based app that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI).
   - Uses Streamlit for building interactive web applications.

### 9️⃣ **Build a Python Website with Streamlit**
   - A simple Streamlit-based website with interactive components.
   - Demonstrates UI components and user interaction in Streamlit.
