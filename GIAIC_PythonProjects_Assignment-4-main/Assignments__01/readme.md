# Assignment 2 - Basic & Intermediate Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains multiple projects categorized into **Basic** and **Intermediate** levels, focusing on Python programming fundamentals. Each project enhances logical thinking and coding skills.

---

## 🚀 Basic Projects
These are beginner-friendly projects to strengthen foundational concepts:

### 1️⃣ **JokeBot**
   - A simple Python bot that tells random jokes.
   - Uses a predefined list of jokes.
   - Implements basic input/output operations.

### 2️⃣ **Double It**
   - A program that takes a number as input and returns its double.
   - Demonstrates simple mathematical operations.

### 3️⃣ **LiftOff**
   - A countdown timer for a rocket launch.
   - Introduces loops and time functions in Python.

### 4️⃣ **Guess My Number**
   - A number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
   - Uses conditional statements and loops.

### 5️⃣ **Random Number Generator**
   - Generates a random number within a specified range.
   - Uses Python’s `random` module.

## 🏆 Intermediate Projects
These projects introduce control flow, lists, and dictionaries.

### 1️⃣ **Control Flow for Console**
   - Demonstrates conditional statements (`if-else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
   - Implements real-world scenarios using user input.

### 2️⃣ **Intro to Python**
   - Covers Python basics including variables, data types, and functions.
   - Provides interactive exercises to reinforce concepts.

### 3️⃣ **Lists & Dictionaries**
   - Explores Python’s list and dictionary data structures.
   - Includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on lists and dictionaries.
